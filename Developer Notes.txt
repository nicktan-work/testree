Approach
--------
1) Make some Markup for the HTML form
  - Case a based HTML page
  - Created a form
  - Added the form buttons
  - Added the form inputs for name, phone
  - Added the content for the menu items
  - Wrapped very thing in a <div> to make it vertical
  - added the quy input fields for each item that had a price
  - Added the pickup from the from example javascript_events/LotteryTickets/index.html

2) Add some simply CSS to style the form
  - Wrap the form in a border
  - Apply some basic formatting to have a vertical form

3) Look for some JavaScript that gets information from the form


4) Calculates a math equation (qty * price = ItemCost)
  - Get the Qty from a input on the screen
  - Convert the string value from the input field to a number
  - multiple the numeric qty * the price 
  - 


5) Calculate the total of all items purchase (SUM)

6) How do I debug the JavaScript?

7) How can I show the values of variables without knowing how to ouput the
   variables into the web page yet?

8) How do I update the screen with my calculation answer


Personal Notes
--------------
I determined that it was better to write a generic function that I could call 
to pass in an ID, and have it retrive the quantity from the input field with
that ID.  I had written a function for each ID, I would have so many functions
that were the exact same code, with only the id being different.  Something like 
GetQtyOfItem("qty-Pizza1"), and that function would find the qty, convert it to a
numeric value, and return me the number so I could assign it to a variable.

I also determined that rather than call a specific function for each <input type='num'>
that had the quantity of the item the consumer wanted to order, that it would be better
to call a generic "UpdateTheOrder()" type function, and allow that function to call
the the GetQtyOfItem(id) method for each qty, and then do the math to figure out the
prices, etc.

I then added the onchange="UpdateTheOrder();" on each of the <input type="number">
elements in the HTML markup field
e.g.
   <input type="number" id="qty-Pizza1" name="QtyPizza1" min=0 max=25 onchange="UpdateTheOrder();">
   <input type="number" id="qty-Pizza2" name="QtyPizza2" min=0 max=25 onchange="UpdateTheOrder();">
    etc.
